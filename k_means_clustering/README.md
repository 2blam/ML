### Description

Topic: Clustering

Mission: 
Mall dataset with client's membership card information.
Each client with information about income, spending and spending scores.
After collecting the data, they would like to segment the customers into a number of clusters.

Model: K-means clustering

IMPORTANT:
- random initialization trap - solution: k-means++ (need to further have a look)
- number of clusters - Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS); 
plot a graph about number of cluster vs WCSS and look for "elbow"
