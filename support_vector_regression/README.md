Topic: Regression

Using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to find the relationship between Position Level and Salary.

Mission: A new employee is working as a region manager for about 2 years,HR would like to check how much salary they should offer to this new employee. For the region manager with 2 years experience, refer to the dataset, the position level should be between 6 and 7. Suppose the positon level is 6.5, help the HR to predict the salary for this new employee.

## IMPORTANT
- In Python, if we use sklearn library for SVR, it is necessary to rescale the features for SVR. Unlike the other models, the SVR in sklearn did not rescale the features!
